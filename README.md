# Python-Projects

This is where I'll post my progress and projects as I learn Python.

When viewing each Python project you'll see comments added to inform you of what it does.

You may also see some things regarding software development. 

When running some of my scripts, it's best to run them in either Spyder or VS code by copy and pasting them in the window and seeing the output in the terminal.
I've noticed with some of my Python scripts, they don't seem to run properly in Python's console. Please use either Spyder, VS code, or a another script reader of your choice.

Most, if not all of my projects are free to use, just don't sell them and claim ownership.
Thank you.
